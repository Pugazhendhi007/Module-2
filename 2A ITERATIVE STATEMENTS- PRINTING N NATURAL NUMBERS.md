## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ BINARY NUMBER PATTERN

###  Aim
To create a Python  program to print binary number pattern of n rows and m columns using loop

###  Algorithm

1. Start
2. Input the number of rows
3. Input the number of columns
4. Repeat the following steps for each row (from 1 to rows):
   - Repeat the following for each column (from 1 to columns):
     - Print `1` without moving to the next line
   - Move to the next line after printing all columns
5. End



### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO. 212223060214
#Name. s pugazhendhi
#Write your Code here
def binary_pattern(rows, columns):
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(columns):
            print('1', end='')
        print()

# Taking input from the user
rows = int(input())
columns = int(input())

# Printing the binary pattern
binary_pattern(rows, columns)


```
